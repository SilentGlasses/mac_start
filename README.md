# Welcome

Welcome to Mac Start - a beginners guide to macOS.  

I have used Apple machines over the years at work and always had to refer to my notepad each time I needed to setup a new one.

Yes I know, I can use Terraform, Git and such to automatically do this for me. But I like the feeling of accomplishment that building one by hand offers. I mean, it's only every so many years apart that I have to do this, I don't have a ton of these I build out. But I digress.

I thought that if I find these instructions handy, others would too. And most of the times, users just go scurry the web in hopes of finding something useful and you get bits and pieces of things over different channels.

This site will host the more common and useful things to do with a new Apple machine as well as some specific recommendations and some helpful tips to finish it off.

Hope you keep coming back for more.

If you have a better way to do something I have listed here, or want to contribute, feel free to fork and submit a PR.

Thanks,

## Making Changes

- **Always** use forks and feature branches
- **Do Not** use caps or spaces when naming directories or files, ex:
    - `new_file_name.md`
    - `my_new_directory_name`
- To make sure you're not submitting breaking changes, **ALWAYS** test your changes on your local site.
    - This will ensure the site functions properly and that your changes/additions render properly.
- If you add new pages, you will also need to add them to the `nav` section of `mkdocs.yaml` where you want them to show up.
